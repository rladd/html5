<h2>The Laboratory</h2>
<h3>Electronic Heaven.</h3>

<p class="normalText">Hi. My name is Ross. I started playing with machines at a very young age when my father brought home a 286 from his office. I guess I was only seven years old - but that is all that it took for me to realize that computers were my future.</p>

<p>As years go by, I began to learn every language that I could. First was basic, then qBasic, then Pascal, C, and ultimately Assembly. At the same time, I was starting to play with audio production, so I joined a non-profit multimedia group which specialized in digital arts. We began to put my digital creations to vibrant visual displays and I was hooked. We had a team that <i>rocked</i> and we put our stuff out there on the demo scene (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxGtPAhkEQU" target="_new">UnReal by FutureCrew</a> if you're not sure what I'm talking about).
</p>

<p>Nowadays, I spend my time mainly programming / creating websites that matter. Of course, I will always be an open source advocate, but right now I put an emphasis on Content Management with the goal of bringing CMS to the forefront using tools like Drupal, WordRress, and anything under the sun that helps me to continue moving forward.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please give me a shout @ <a href="mailto:ross@element63.com">ross@element63.com</a> and I can give you some more information. Life for me is a digital playground, and anything is possible.</p>
